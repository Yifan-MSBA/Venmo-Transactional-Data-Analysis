# Venmo-Transactional-Data-Analysis

In this project, we analyzed a sample of Venmo's transaction dataset using Spark. Our primary objectives were to gain a comprehensive understanding of users' spending behaviors, explore their social networks, and predict the frequency of future transactions. We divided the project into three key parts to answer each question separately. Details can be found in code files and project report uploaded.
